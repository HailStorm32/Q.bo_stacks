A Repository for the Qbo Robot stacks and associated files running under ROS "Hydro"-Ubuntu 12.04

Combined files mix and matched from these two repositories:

*[OpenQbo](https://github.com/OpenQbo)
*[Neo_robot](https://github.com/elpimous/Neo_robot/tree/master/HYDRO)


To install these stacks you must create a "/stacks" folder in your "/opt/ros/hydro/" folder and install all the directories and files in this Repo. Also there are folders labeled "Dependencies" in some stacks that may have necessary files and or instructions for proper installation.
